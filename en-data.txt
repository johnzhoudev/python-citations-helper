There are many climate modelling groups around the world that perform simulations with dozens of GCMs. Results are contributed to the World Climate Research Programme’s Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP; Taylor et al., 2012<sup id='ref6-1-rf'><a class='fn-lnk' href='#ref6'><span class='wb-inv'>Reference </span>6</a></sup>; Eyring et al., 2016<sup id='ref7-1-rf'><a class='fn-lnk' href='#ref7'><span class='wb-inv'>Reference </span>7</a></sup>). The fifth phase of CMIP (CMIP5) informed the IPCC 5th Assessment Report (IPCC, 2013)<sup id='ref4-2-rf'><a class='fn-lnk' href='#ref4'><span class='wb-inv'>Reference </span>4</a></sup> and a sixth phase (CMIP6) will inform the IPCC 6th Assessment Report (planned release, 2021). While based on the same underlying principles, groups may parameterize unresolved physical processes – for example simplified representations of cloud properties and cloud microphysics – in slightly different ways and make different choices about model structure (Alexander and Easterbrook, 2015)<sup id='ref8-1-rf'><a class='fn-lnk' href='#ref8'><span class='wb-inv'>Reference </span>8</a></sup> and horizontal and vertical resolution. The result is that different climate models respond to the same external forcing in somewhat different ways. As an example, <a href='#figure-2.1'>Figure 2.1b</a> shows model resolution and equilibrium climate sensitivity – the long-term global mean temperature change associated with a doubling of CO2 concentration – for 26 CMIP5 climate models. Differences in cloud feedback stemming from differences in model parameterizations of cloud properties and microphysics are responsible for much of the current spread in climate sensitivity (Zelinka et al., 2017)<sup id='ref9-1-rf'><a class='fn-lnk' href='#ref9'><span class='wb-inv'>Reference </span>9</a></sup>. While the spread in climate sensitivity is reducible in principle as our understanding of physical processes and ability to represent them in GCMs improves, the diversity among models is considered a healthy aspect of the climate modelling community and is one source of uncertainty in future climate change projections at global and regional scales.
